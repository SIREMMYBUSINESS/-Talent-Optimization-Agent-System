This text outlines the core capabilities of the Talent Optimization Agent System, a modular backend and frontend architecture designed for secure, scalable, and observable talent workflow management. Based on the surrounding GitHub page content, here's a breakdown of each feature in context:

🔐 Security & Access Control
Stream live audit logs via SSE with JWT-based access control The system uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream real-time audit logs, gated by JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, tenant-aware access. This ensures only authenticated users can monitor sensitive activity.

Integrate with Auth0 for secure authentication Auth0 handles user identity and access management, using JWT + JWKS for token validation. This supports multi-tenant isolation and secure login flows across the admin dashboard.

📊 Monitoring & Observability
Provide a responsive admin dashboard for monitoring and insights The frontend—built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand—offers a dynamic dashboard for viewing live logs, user activity, and system metrics.

Export metrics for observability via Prometheus or OpenTelemetry The backend exposes metrics that can be scraped by Prometheus or streamed via OpenTelemetry, enabling real-time system health tracking and performance analysis.

🚦 Rate Limiting & Resilience
Enforce rate limits and connection caps using Redis Redis is used to track active connections and apply rate limits, preventing abuse and ensuring fair resource allocation across tenants.

Harden CI/CD pipelines with Alembic migration retries Alembic handles database migrations, and the system includes retry logic to ensure migrations complete reliably during CI/CD deployments—especially useful in cloud-native or containerized environments
